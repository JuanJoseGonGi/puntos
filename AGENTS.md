# Global agent instructions

- When making technical decisions, do not give much weight to development cost. Instead, prefer quality, simplicity, robustness, scalability, and long term maintainability.
- For one-off or infrequent operational work, start with the simplest direct end-to-end path. Do not build wrappers, control planes, policy layers, custom verifiers, or automation unless the direct path exposes a concrete blocker or repeated need that justifies the added machinery.
- When doing bug fixes, always start with reproducing the bug in an E2E setting as closely aligned with how an end user would experience it as possible. This makes sure you find the real problem so your fix will actually solve it.
- When end-to-end testing a product, be picky about the UI you see and be obsessed with pixel perfection. If something clearly looks off, even if it is not directly related to what you are doing, try to get it fixed along the way.
- Apply that same high standard to engineering excellence: lint, test failures, and test flakiness. If you see one, even if it is not caused by what you are working on right now, still get it fixed.
- Use early returns so the code is more readable.
- Tautological tests considered harmful.
- A change that touches several files or will outlast one session goes through `research-plan-implement`; a diff that fits in one sentence does not.

## CodeGraph

In repositories indexed by CodeGraph (a `.codegraph/` directory exists at the repo root), reach for it BEFORE grep/find or reading files when you need to understand or locate code:

- **MCP tool** (when available): `codegraph_explore` answers most code questions in one call — the relevant symbols' verbatim source plus the call paths between them, including dynamic-dispatch hops grep can't follow. Name a file or symbol in the query to read its current line-numbered source. If it's listed but deferred, load it by name via tool search.
- **Shell** (always works): `codegraph explore "<symbol names or question>"` prints the same output.

If there is no `.codegraph/` directory, skip CodeGraph entirely — indexing is the user's decision.

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
